[h1][b]Insurgency+ Tactical Rebalance Theater Mod[/b][/h1] 

[h1][b]If you would like to run this on a local bot game:[/b][/h1]
You can run this locally however by first opening console and typing "mp_theater_override insplus_default". Then you can load up any map, coop or regular pvp with bots to try it out. 

[h1][b]Major Changes:[/b][/h1]
- Reworked classes/weapons for slightly more faction asymmetry
- Whole new coop checkpoint enemy squads (stealth silencer sqauds and flashbang shock troopers)
- Intensified suppression system
- Freeaim while aiming down sights
- Weapons now have tangible mechanic differences regarding freeaim radius, barrel length, focus zoom, and attachment availability
- Sprint speed scaling with stamina (top sprint speed decreases the more tired you get)
- Reworked some attachment benefits to feel slightly less like straight upgrades and more like role/playstyle specializations
- [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kqc5PMS0QoIbHpxE9HaW1yDHEC4FmZDxl91umJ-k2R0/edit?pli=1#gid=0]Reworked AP and HP ammo benefits[/url]
- Significantly increased stamina drain and sway when taking hits
- Any hits taken above the legs will only reduce speed by at most 10% (leg shots slow by 75%)
- Increased armor effectiveness against most bullets, including AP. 
- Overall TTK increased. Shot placement, armor, and ammo type are a lot more important now.

[h1][b]Attachment benefits:[/b][/h1]
Note: modifiers to freeaim radius affect both hipfire and ironsight radius. Decreasing radius constricts the boudaries of your freeaim, meaning your weapon barrel will fall more towards the center of your screen. Increasing the radius has the opposite effect.

- Increases sway radius by 20%
[b]Lasersights:[/b]
