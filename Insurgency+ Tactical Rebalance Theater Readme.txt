[h1][b]Insurgency+ Tactical Realism Theater Mod[/b][/h1] 

[h1][b]If you would like to run this on a local bot game:[/b][/h1]
You can run this locally however by first opening console and typing "mp_theater_override insplus_default". Then you can load up any map, coop or regular pvp with bots to try it out. 

[h1][b]Major Changes:[/b][/h1]
- Reworked classes/weapons for more faction asymmetry
- Whole new coop checkpoint enemy squads (stealth silencer sqauds and flashbang shock troopers)
- Intensified suppression system
- Expanded freeaim system into ironsights
- Weapons now have tangible mechanic differences regarding freeaim, barrel length, focus zoom, rate of file, and attachment availability
- Sprint speed scaling with stamina (sprint speed decreases the more tired you get)
- Reworked HP an AP ammo availiblity for more meaningful balance between weapon choices
- Significantly increased stamina drain and sway when taking hits
- Increased armor effectiveness against most bullets while still retaining the lethality of combat

[h1][b]Attachment benefits:[/b][/h1]
Note: modifiers to freeaim radius affect both hipfire and ironsight radius. Decreasing radius constricts the boudaries of your freeaim, meaning your weapon barrel will fall more towards the center of your screen. Increasing the radius has the opposite effect.
