# Insurgency+ Tactical Realism Theater Mod
## About
This is a custom gameplay modification for Insurgency. It includes various gameplay tweaks and changes to Vanilla Insurgency's classes, weapons, gear, movement, damage model, and more. 

The intended result of this mod is to make Insuegency into a much slower paced, tactical, and realistc shooter than it already is.

## Major Changes
- Reworked classes/weapons for more faction asymmetry
- Whole new coop checkpoint enemy squads (stealth silencer sqauds and flashbang shock troopers)
- Intensified suppression system
- Intensified and harsh Recoil
- Weapons now have tangible mechanic differences regarding freeaim radius, barrel length, ironsight in and out time, overall recoil, and attachment availability
- Sprint speed scaling with stamina (sprint speed decreases the more tired you get)
- Reworked some attachment benefits to feel slightly less like straight upgrades and more like quality of life upgrades
- Slightly reworked AP and HP ammo mechanics for balance and realism
- Revamped damage model for almost all ammo types to be closer to real life performance 
- Significantly increased stamina drain and sway when taking hits
- Reworked armor effectiveness to be more protective while still maintaining the lethality of combat

## Disclaimer
I do not own the custom models and sounds used in this mod, nor did I originally create them.

The sounds used by the weapon were a mix made from the default SKS, AK74, and FAL
- http://gamebanana.com/sounds/23701 for P226, Deagle, and Tokarev
- http://gamebanana.com/sounds/26914 for M27 IAR
- http://gamebanana.com/sounds/26910 for M4 Carbine

Only firing sounds were used. All sounds mixed with the vanilla sounrds (M4, M9, makarov, M45/M1911) for each weapon.
