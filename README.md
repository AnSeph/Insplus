# Insurgency+ Tactical Rebalance Theater Mod
## About
This is a custom gameplay modification for Insurgency. It includes various gameplay tweaks and changes to Vanilla Insurgency's classes, weapons, gear, movement, damage model, and more. 

The intended result of this mod is to make Insuegency into a much slower paced, tactical, and realistc shooter than it already is.

## Major Changes
- Reworked classes/weapons and ammo for more faction asymmetry
- Whole new coop checkpoint enemy squads (stealth silencer sqauds and flashbang shock troopers)
- Intensified suppression system
- Freeaim while aiming down sights
- Weapons now have tangible mechanic differences regarding freeaim radius, barrel length, focus zoom, and attachment availability
- Sprint speed scaling with stamina (sprint speed decreases the more tired you get)
- Reworked some attachment benefits to feel slightly less like straight upgrades and more like role/playstyle specializations
- Reworked AP and HP ammo
- Revamped damage model for almot all ammo types to be closer to real life performance 
- Significantly increased stamina drain and sway when taking hits
- Reworked armor effectiveness to be more protective while still maintaining the lethality of combat
